#AngularJS and ES6

ES6 modules and classes are really powerful, and if used correctly, can make Angular 1.x code more readable, testable, and portable.  They can also organize Angular 1.x code to look much more like Angular 2, making the transition much easier if your team ever wants to do it.

This repo demonstrates how to use ES6 modules and classes in an Angular project.  It also includes a sample webpack configuration

## Instructions

run:
```
npm install
webpack
````
